# FastAPI WordPress Auth & License Middleware 🚀

A robust and secure middleware server built with FastAPI that acts as a bridge between a client application via websocket connection and a WordPress backend. It handles user authentication via encrypted password hash and JWT token, license validation against WooCommerce API Manager, and persistent session management for multiple floating licenses per client. This will allow a user to register on your WordPress website, purchase a license or multiple licesense, then login to your app with their WordPress credentials if they have an active license.

NOTE: This was a project I never intended on releasing publicly. So there are some things like naming conventions that will be tailored towards me.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Secure WordPress Authentication**: Authenticates users against a WordPress database, with full support for modern `bcrypt` (`$wp$`) password hashes.
- **JWT Token Management**: Interfaces with a WordPress JWT plugin to generate and manage authentication tokens.
- **WooCommerce License API Integration**: Manages the complete license lifecycle (`activate`, `deactivate`, `status`) by communicating with the plugin ~~WooCommerce API Manager~~ Kestrel API Manager for WooCommerce.
- **Persistent Session Management**: Uses a dedicated PostgreSQL database to store and track active client sessions, ensuring stateful tracking across server restarts.
- **Automatic Session Cleanup**: A background `asyncio` task runs periodically to find and deactivate expired sessions, keeping the system clean.
- **Centralized & Configurable Logging**: All server and application logs are centralized, configurable, and can be piped to both the console and a log file (`app.log`).
- **Container-Ready**: Comes with a `dockerfile` for easy, reproducible deployments in any containerized environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This server is designed as a secure middleware layer. It prevents direct exposure of your WordPress database and API keys to the client application.

## 🔧 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the server running locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Access to a WordPress database (MySQL/MariaDB)
- A running PostgreSQL database

### Wordpress Plugin Prerequisites
- [RoyalAuth](https://github.com/theycallmek/woocommerce-license-server-for-apps/tree/main/Plugin/royal-auth) (Part of this project)
- [Kestrel API Manager for WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/document/api-documentation/)
- [JWT Authentication for WP REST API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/)
- [REST API v2.0](https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API) (Required for JWT Auth Plugin)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/theycallmek/woocommerce-license-server-for-apps
cd woocommerce-license-server-for-apps
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root. Use the following template and fill in your database credentials and other details. **Remember to use quotes for all values to prevent parsing errors.**
You can copy the `.env.example` file, rename it to `.env`, and replace the example values to make it easy.

```env
# .env

# WordPress Database (MySQL/MariaDB)
WP_MYSQL_USER="your_wp_db_user"
WP_MYSQL_PASS="your_wp_db_password"
WP_MYSQL_HOST="your_wp_db_host"
WP_MYSQL_PORT="3306"
WP_MYSQL_DB_NAME="your_wp_db_name"

# Session Database (PostgreSQL)
PG_USER="your_pg_user"
PG_PASSWORD="your_pg_password"
PG_HOST="your_pg_host"
PG_DB_NAME="your_pg_db_name"
```

### 4. Configure .py File Constants

Open `login_server.py` and update **URL** on line 34. Update it with your WordPress websites URL (https://example_wordpress_url.com/).

### 5. Initialize the Session Database

Run the `create_pg_db.py` script once to create the necessary tables (`user_sessions` and `logs`) in your PostgreSQL database.

```sh
python create_pg_db.py
```

### 6. Run the Server

Use the `entry.py` script to start the Uvicorn server with live reloading and configured logging.

```sh
python entry.py
```

The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## 👨‍💻 Developer Guide

This guide provides additional details for developers working on this middleware.

### Core Logic

- **`login_server.py`**: This is the main FastAPI application file. It defines all API endpoints, data models (using SQLModel), and database interactions.
    - **Authentication Flow**: The `/login` endpoint takes a username and password. It first queries the WordPress MySQL database to get the user's data, including their hashed password. It then uses the `verify_pw_hash` function to securely check the provided password against the hash. If valid, it calls out to the WordPress site's JWT plugin to get an authentication token.
    - **License Management Flow**: The `/license/{action}` endpoint orchestrates license management. It first retrieves the user's license data (the `master_api_key`) from the `wp_wc_am_api_resource` table in the WordPress database. It then creates or updates a session in the local PostgreSQL database. Finally, it makes a server-to-server request to the WooCommerce API Manager endpoint on the live WordPress site to perform the requested action (`activate`, `deactivate`, or `status`).
    - **Session Handling**: The server maintains its own session state in a PostgreSQL database (`user_sessions` table). This allows it to track which users have active license sessions. A background task (`deactivate_expired_sessions`) runs continuously to clean up sessions that have been inactive for a set period, automatically deactivating the license on the WordPress side.
    - **Testing WordPress Configuration**: `login_server.py` can also be used to test your WordPress Configuration. To make sure the plugins are all functioning properly and you can communicate with the WordPress server properly. To do so, edit `login_server.py` starting on line 976 update **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** with a user/pass that has been registered on your WordPress website. Finally, run `python login_server.py` and the console will show the response from the server.

- **`login_client.py`**: This is a simple Python client script that demonstrates how to interact with the FastAPI server. It shows the full authentication and license activation/status check cycle. It's useful for testing the server endpoints locally. To use it, Update **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** and run the file `python login_client.py`.

### Database Models

The application uses `SQLModel` for ORM capabilities.

- **WordPress Models** (`WPUsers`, `WPWCAMApiActivation`, `WPWCAMApiResource`): These models map directly to tables in the WordPress database. They are used for read-only operations to fetch user and license data.
- **Session Models** (`UserSession`, `Logs`): These models map to tables created in the dedicated PostgreSQL database. They are used for read-write operations to manage sessions and log events.

### Setup and Configuration Notes

- **Password Hashing**: The `verify_pw_hash` function is critical. It correctly handles the modern `$wp$` bcrypt hashes used by recent WordPress versions. This requires the `bcrypt` and `passlib` libraries.
- **Environment Variables**: The use of a `.env` file is crucial for security. Never hard-code credentials in the source code. The `dotenv` library loads these variables at startup.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: The server uses `asyncio` and `asyncpg` for non-blocking database calls to the PostgreSQL session database, ensuring high performance. Interactions with the WordPress MySQL database are synchronous as `mysql-connector-python` does not have mature `asyncio` support.
